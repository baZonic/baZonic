- Hi, Iâ€™m @baZonic or Daniel

- I'm intressted in playing games and making games. I go to gymnasium for game making, no more information will be shared... mostly because I don't want to write it.
- I am not currently interested in meeting people here but I will publish my work here if I feel it is worthy to share.

- My favorite game genres are Survival, RPG, Open-World and Action. Those are just buzzwords but I think I like them.

Know for sure: Cool server
